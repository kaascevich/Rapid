// MARK: - Run

/// Runs a closure as an expression.
///
/// This is a more elegant way of creating a self-executing closure. Instead
/// of doing something like this...
///
/// ```swift
/// let something = {
///     // ...statements...
/// }()
/// ```
///
/// ...you can do this:
///
/// ```swift
/// let something = run {
///     // ...statements...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Don't overuse this, though. If you're not returning a value, and just want
/// to execute code in a seperate scope, use Swift's `do` keyword:
///
/// ```swift
/// do {
///     // ...statements...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Parameter closure: The closure to execute.
///
/// - Returns: The closure's return value, if any.
///
