// MARK: - Run

/// Runs a closure as an expression.
///
/// This is a more elegant way of creating a self-executing closure. Instead
/// of doing something like this...
///
/// ```swift
/// let something = {
///     // ...statements...
/// }()
/// ```
///
/// ...you can do this:
///
/// ```swift
/// let something = run {
///     // ...statements...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Don't overuse this, though. If you're not returning a value, and just want
/// to execute code in a seperate scope, use Swift's `do` keyword:
///
/// ```swift
/// do {
///     // ...statements...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Parameter closure: The closure to execute.
///
/// - Returns: The closure's return value, if any.
///
/// ## See Also
///
/// - ``run(with:_:)``
/// - ``configure(_:_:)``
@inlinable public func run<T>(_ closure: () throws -> T) rethrows -> T {
    try closure()
}

/// Executes a closure, passing it a copy of the provided value..
///
/// The `run(with:_:)` method is useful when you need to perform several
/// operations involving a specific value. For instance, the following
/// code:
///
/// ```swift
/// run(with: editor) {
///     $0.click()
///     $0.typeKey("a", modifierFlags: .command)
///     $0.typeKey(.delete, modifierFlags: [])
/// }
/// ```
///
/// is equivalent to:
///
/// ```swift
/// editor.click()
/// editor.typeKey("a", modifierFlags: .command)
/// editor.typeKey(.delete, modifierFlags: [])
/// ```
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - value: Anything.
///   - closure: The closure to execute. Recieves a copy of `value`.
///
/// ## See Also
///
/// - ``run(_:)``
/// - ``configure(_:_:)``
@inlinable public func run<T>(with value: T, _ closure: (T) throws -> Void) rethrows {
    try closure(value)
}

/// Mutates a copy of the provided value.
///
/// The `configure(_:_:)` method mutates a copy of the given value and
/// returns the result. It's useful for types that require properties to
/// be configured, such as formatter components:
///
/// ```swift
/// let components = configure(PersonNameComponents()) {
///     $0.givenName = "John"
///     $0.familyName = "Appleseed"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - value: Anything.
///   - closure: The closure to execute. Recieves a copy of `value` to
///     mutate.
///
/// - Returns: The return value of the closure.
///
/// ## See Also
///
/// - ``run(_:)``
/// - ``run(with:_:)``
@inlinable public func configure<T>(_ value: T, _ closure: (inout T) throws -> Void) rethrows -> T {

    try closure(&copy)
    return copy
