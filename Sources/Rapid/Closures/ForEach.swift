  /// ```swift

  /// // Prints "0"
  /// // Prints "1"
  /// // Prints "2"

  /// important ways:
  ///
  /// 1. You cannot use a `break` or `continue` statement to exit the current
  ///    call of the `body` closure or skip subsequent calls.
  /// 2. Using the `return` statement in the `body` closure will exit only from
  ///    the current call to `body`, not from any outer scope, and won't skip
  ///    subsequent calls.
  ///
  /// - Parameter body: A closure that takes an instance of `Self` as a
  ///   parameter.
