    /// 1. You cannot use a `break` or `continue` statement to exit the current
    ///    call of the `body` closure or skip subsequent calls.
    /// 2. Using the `return` statement in the `body` closure will exit only from
    ///    the current call to `body`, not from any outer scope, and won't skip
    ///    subsequent calls.
    ///
