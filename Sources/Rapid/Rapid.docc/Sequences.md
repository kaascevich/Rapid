Safely access collection elements, and filter sequences in more expressive ways.

## Topics

### Sets

 - ``Swift/SetAlgebra/+(_:_:)``
 - ``Swift/SetAlgebra/+=(_:_:)``
 - ``Swift/SetAlgebra/-(_:_:)``
 - ``Swift/SetAlgebra/-=(_:_:)``

### Indexing

 - ``Swift/Collection/subscript(ifExists:)``

### Emptiness

 - ``Swift/Collection/isNotEmpty``
 - ``Swift/Optional/isNilOrEmpty``
 - ``Swift/Optional/isNotNilOrEmpty``

### Counting

- ``Swift/Sequence/count(of:)-9tin5``
- ``Swift/Sequence/count(of:)-9ifmz``

### Filtering

- ``Swift/Sequence/noneSatisfy(_:)``
- ``Swift/Sequence/last(where:)``
- ``Swift/RangeReplaceableCollection/removeAll(occurrencesOf:)``
