    /// the last element of a collection, so it doesn't correspond with an
    /// element.

    ///   otherwise, O(*n*), where *n* is the length of the collection.
    ///
    /// - Parameter position: The position of the element to access.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The element at the specified position, or `nil` if it
    ///   doesn't exist.
