import func CwlPreconditionTesting.catchBadInstruction

/// Runs the provided block, and returns `true` if it crashed during execution.
///
/// This function runs the provided block in a separate thread and watches for
/// calls to `fatalError` and friends. If one of these calls occurs, this
/// function returns `true`; if the block ran without crashing, it returns
/// `false` instead.
///
/// If the block throws a Swift error during execution, this function returns
/// `true`.
///
/// - Warning: **Do _not_ call this function outside of a testing context.**
///
///   This function calls `CwlPreconditionTesting.catchBadInstruction(in:)` to
///   check for crashes; that function uses Objective-C exceptions internally.
///   The vast majority of Swift and Objective-C functions are _not_
///   exception-safe; therefore, calling this function outside of a testing
///   context is **undefined behavior**.
///
/// - Parameter block: A block to run.
///
/// - Returns: `true` if the block crashed during execution; otherwise, `false`.
