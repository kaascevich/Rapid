# Changelog

## 3.0.1

Hi, I'm back (again)!

You may have noticed that Rapid is now hosted on Codeberg. I've decided to
migrate my projects away from GitHub for a number of reasons, chief among them
being that GitHub itself is not free and open source software.

> I _am_ planning on mirroring Rapid to GitHub at some point to keep its listing
> on the Swift Package Index up-to-date, but Codeberg is Rapid's new home.

Aside from that, this is pretty much just a minor modernization update.

- Switched the license (again) to the GNU Affero GPL
- Updated to Swift 6.1
- Removed explicit dependency on `swift-testing` as it's now included with the
  toolchain

## 3.0.0

Hello, I still exist! Sorry for not updating for so long... school ðŸ˜”

A bunch of this update is dedicated to bringing Rapid up-to-date with all the
fancy-schmancy newness of Swift 6.

### Additions

- `~=` operator for `Regex`
- `!!` operator for calling a never-returning function when optional unwrapping
  fails
- `AnyType` and `Nothing` typealiases for `Any.Type` and `Void`, respectively
- `sum()` and `product()` methods for `Numeric` sequences
- `compacted()` method for `Sequence`
- `**` and `**=` operators
- `ExpressibleByEmptyArrayLiteral` and `ExpressibleByEmptyDictionaryLiteral`
  protocols

### Updates

- Updated `?!` operator with typed `throws`

### Deprecations

- There's now a `count(where:)` method in the standard library, rendering one of
  Rapid's `count(of:)` methods obsolete. This method has thus been deprecated,
  and will be removed in Rapid 4.
  - `count(where:)` should work as a drop-in replacement for your projects --
    and if you were using trailing closures, you might not even have to update
    your code at all!
  - The overload of `count(of:)` that takes an element instead of a predicate
    was kept, since the standard library doesn't have a direct equivalent to it
    (yet).

### Removals

- `++`, `--`, `&++`, and `&--` operators

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the `count` parameter of `String.*(_:_:)` to be a `UInt` instead of an
  `Int`

### Other

- Changed license from the GNU GPL v3 to the MIT License
  - What this practically means is that, from this version (3.0.0) onwards,
    Rapid can now legally be used in software that isn't open source (as well as
    some other things that stem from or alongside this). No existing users
    should be affected by this change.
- General documentation polish
- Migrated tests from Quick/Nimble to swift-testing

## 2.3.0

- Added `appendInterpolation(_:format:)` and `appendInterpolation(_:if:)` string
  interpolation methods
- `SetAlgebra` now has `+`, `+=`, `-`, and `-=` operators
- Added `~=` operators for `Error` and `KeyPath`
- Added `sorted(by:)` and `sorted(by:using:)` methods to `Sequence`
- The package previously did not build on anything other than macOS. This has
  **hopefully** been fixed.

## 2.2.0

- `CollectionOfOne` now conforms to `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral`
- Added an `asInt` property and an `init(fromInt:)` initializer to `Bool`
- Minor documentation improvements

## 2.1.1

- `EmptyCollection` now conforms to `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral` and
  `ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral`, with element types of `Never` to prevent use
  of non-empty literals

## 2.1.0

- Added `mutate(_:using:)` function to mutate values directly
- `PartialRangeFrom`, `PartialRangeThrough`, and `PartialRangeUpTo` now conform
  to `Equatable` `Hashable`, `CustomStringConvertible`,
  `CustomDebugStringConvertible`, and `CustomReflectable`
- Added `AnyEquatable`, a type-erased wrapper for `Equatable`

## 2.0.0

- `isBetween(_:)` now accepts a `RangeExpression` instead of only a
  `ClosedRange`
- Replaced the `?!` operator's `ErrorType` with `some Error`
- The `++`, `--`, `&++`, and `&--` operators have been marked as unavailable.
  They will be removed entirely in Rapid 3.
- Added `minutes(_:)`, `hours(_:)`, `days(_:)`, and `weeks(_:)` static methods
  to `Duration`
  - Each method has two overloads: one taking `some BinaryInteger`, and one
    taking a `Double`

## 1.3.0

- General documentation improvements (fixing typos and whatnot).

### Potentially Breaking Changes

- `repeat(_:)` now starts iteration from 0 instead of 1, to more closely match
  the behavior of the standard library
  - Issues caused by this should be trivial to fix -- just add 1 to the loop
    index each time you use it
- Removed `@inlinable` from everything -- it doesn't make life any easier

## 1.2.0

- The `++`, `--`, `&++`, and `&--` operators have been deprecated; see
  [this Swift Evolution proposal][proposal] for reasons as to why. Use `+= 1`,
  `-= 1`, `&+= 1`, and `&-= 1` instead. The operators will be marked as
  unavailable in Rapid 2, and will be removed entirely in Rapid 3.
- `Clamped` now conforms to `Sendable` when its `Value` type is `Sendable`
- Added the `<-` operator as an alias for `configure(_:using:)`
- Added `isNilOrEmpty` and `isNotNilOrEmpty` for optional collections

[proposal]: https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0004-remove-pre-post-inc-decrement.md

## 1.1.0

- A `factorial()` method has been added to `BinaryInteger`
- Added `@Clamped`, `@Transformed`, and `@Validated` property wrappers
- Added `clamped(to:)` and `clamp(to:)` methods to `Comparable`

## 1.0.0

I'm really bad at making incremental releases.

Here are the most major changes:

- Rapid now has _vastly_ improved documentation all around
- `Chainable` has been removed in favor of global functions
  - `then(_:)` for value types has been moved to `configure(_:using:)`
  - The dedicated `then(_:)` method for reference types has been removed
  - `do(_:)` has been moved to `run(with:do:)`

Other, more minor changes:

- Operator aliases -- `â‰ `, `â‰¤` and `â‰¥` -- have been added
- A global `Ï€` constant for `Double.pi` has been added
- The `@inlinable` attribute has been applied to most methods and properties
- The implementation of `last(where:)` has been changed to use `first(where:)`
  instead of a `for`-`in` loop
- A default value for the `Component` associated type of `ResultBuilder` has
  been added
- The `throws` and `rethrows` keywords have been added to the `String` and
  `Array` result builder initializers
- `SimpleResultBuilder` has been renamed to `ResultBuilder`
- The `?!` operator for throwing an error when optional unwrapping fails has
  been added

I've also decided that Rapid will be kept API stable from this point onward to
the best of my ability.

## 0.2.0

- The `SimpleResultBuilder` protocol and related types have been added

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
